# WWE-2k25-for-Archipelago-Manual-
A manual file for WWE 2k25 to be used with Archipelago.

Hey so I wanted to do this for an Archipelago run I'm doing with my friends so I decided to do this since I really like this game.

Rules:
1. All matches must be completed on Legend Difficulty. You can only check off the match once you have won. If you really can't do this you can go lower, but I made this a rule for myself to make it more difficult.
2. You can only play the characters you have unlocked.
3. You can only use the paybacks that you have unlocked. You are allowed to give any superstar any payback you want as long as it's unlocked.
4. To win, you must complete all matches listed and complete all of Showcase mode.
5. For Showcase mode, you must do all optional objectives that are not time-based. If it is a time-based objective, you do not have to do it.
6. When you go to choose your opponents for your regular matches, you should randomzie your opponents. Just press random once and that's what you go with. If you legitimately lose to your opponent (as in not giving up), then you can re-randomize your opponent's character when you redo the match.
7. All of your opponents must be CPUs. Don't use other players online to easily beat them for free rewards.
8. You cannot play as the Special Guest Referee during the Special Guest Referee matches. They are basically duplicates of regular matches for that reason since the CPUs usually don't go off track.


Important Notes
1. Bloodline Run-In is guaranteed to be in the early sphere of locations, so it can't be locked behind an end-game location.
2. You start off with Eric Bischoff, Ashante Thee Adonis, Valhalla, and Indi Hartwell for free.
3. Items that are marked as important cannot be locked behind the 20 and 30 Entrant Royal Rumbles, although they can still be locked behind the 10 Entrant Royal Rumble.
4. Showcase matches give items equal to the amount of rewards they give you in-game, so they are good for getting a bunch of items early.

The list of Superstars is thinned down to exclude DLC and certain characters that I didn't put in too not bloat it too much, however this list of superstars still makes it so there's too many items for there to be enough for locations, so you might not be able to unlock all of them in an Archipelago game.
The Showcase and Purchasable tags do not affect your gameplay or how you obtain the character, it's just telling you where you can locate the character incase you don't already have it unlocked.
